# Term Basics

<h2>Primary Objective of Term 3</h2>
<p>The goal for Term 3 is the creation of a final capstone project for your portfolio.</p>
<p>Up to this point, you have gone through training to learn the general process that makes up an environment artist's job. Term 2 was meant to lay down a core foundation of skills. In Term 3, you want to not only put those skills into practice, but to expand upon them as well.</p>

<h2>Time Commitment</h2>
<p><strong>Minimum</strong>: 20+ hours per week</p>
<p><strong>Recommended</strong>: 30-40 hours per week</p>
<p>The most important aspect of the course is the work. To be successful, you will want to spend as much time as you can dedicated to doing the work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Can I work full time while taking this course?</strong></p>
<p>It's not recommended, but we understand you have to do what you have to do. Remember to prioritize doing the work above all else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I'm limited on time, how can I still succeed?</strong></p>
<p>Most of our training videos are hosted (unlisted) on YouTube. You can change the playback speed in settings. Watching the training content at 1.5x speed will reduce the time spent watching watching while still being consumable. Remember, the most important thing is doing the work. So you can watch it sped up, take notes, then get in there and just start working on the assignments.</p>
