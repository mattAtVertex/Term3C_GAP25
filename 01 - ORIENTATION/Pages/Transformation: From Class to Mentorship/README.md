# Transformation: From Class to Mentorship

<p>In previous terms, your live sessions were considered classes and were run by Vertex instructors.</p>
<p>In Term 3, your live sessions will go through a transformation. You will meet as a group with a mentor. Our mentors are artists currently working in the industry at AAA studios. They will be mentoring you through your projects and offering insight into current practices in the industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Show your Work!</h3>
<p>Remember that these mentors are currently working in the industry. That means they have a day job and they are offering these sessions in addition to their normal 40+ hour a week. Make sure you have posted your work prior to class starting. Nobody is going to hunt you down and ask for your work. It is your responsibility to post on time.</p>
<p>If you are not getting feedback from your mentor because you are not posting your work, then you only have yourself to blame.</p>
